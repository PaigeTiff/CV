          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class="intro">I am an Interior Designer and Software Engineer. I ♥ cooking, hiking, and coffee.
            Recently was an Interior Designer that influenced clients with a more functional environment. 
            After two years, the craving for a more challenging role struck. 
            I am now dedicating all of my time to learning more about software, computing, and technology.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p class="code"> Just like Interior Design, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, 
                touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.
